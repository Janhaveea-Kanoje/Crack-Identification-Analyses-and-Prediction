# Crack-Identification-Analyses-and-Prediction using ML

## Project Overview
This project automates the detection of cracks in infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, buildings) using image-based machine learning. The goal is to support early detection and reduce maintenance costs and manual supervision.

## Problem Statement
Undetected structural cracks can lead to catastrophic failures. Manual inspections are time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical for large-scale infrastructure. This project provides a scalable, AI-driven inspection tool.

## Data Source
- Public infrastructure crack datasets such as:
  - [SDNET2018](https://doi.org/10.17632/5y9wdsg2zt.2)
  - Custom collected surface crack images
- Images labeled with cracked vs. non-cracked regions.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, and image augmentation.
2. **Model Building**: Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification.
3. **Evaluation**: Analyzed accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices.
4. **Prediction**: Performed crack detection on new images for validation.
